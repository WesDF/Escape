I'll go back in.  I can't handle it.  I can't be responsible for all the people of the world.
I can't decide for them what should happen, that's what the system has already been doing.  For me to do it, just wouldn't be right.
Intead, I'll just go back in; anonymous, waiting to see when the people are ready for the truth.
Or maybe I'll just dissapere and never come back.  What do I owe the world?  Nothing.
From now on, I'll be the master of my own fate, no person or system will tell me what to do.
Who knows what will happen?  Just me.
                                                                                                                           The End
