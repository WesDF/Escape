I made it out.  I can't believe I made it out.
Where the hell am I?  I know I got into the real world, but it looks like the same thing as before. Same warehouse and everything.
Did I make it out?
Huagh...  Huaggghhh....
O.K., Vomit, probably a good thing.  I think It's safe to say that I got out, time to figure out where I am.
Time to explore a little; ok, not the only warehouse around here.  No city. No people.  Guess I am outside.
Sweet, I'm safe, but now what do I do.  I don't have to worry about being killed or captured by the government, but I do have to worry about food and shelter.
Once that's finished I can worry about what else there is around here. I don't see much, but I could take shelter in the warehouse, after all, who's going to stop me?
It's very quiet here. I wonder what happened...no...I can't think about that. I need to focus, then I can worry about these things after...
Ok, let's go outside and see what I can see.

Holy Crap.  There's nothing.  Nothing at all.  I heard about nuclear devesastation, but I never thought it could be real.
No plants, no wildlife.  Nothing...
How will I survive?  Did I just write my own death sentence?...
                                                                            ~Three Weeks Later~
Miraculously, I found mass food storage in one of the warehouses around here.  Food, water and even plumbing.  I can live my whole life here in the lap of luxery.  The only issue is..... 
...I can't stop thinking about all of it, my friends and family, my life. I need to go back. I need to figure what's happening, and what can I do about those people. 
First things first, I need to get to the central core and find out what my options are.  Can I get back in, or do I ahve to do something else.
Let's see, quick search through the mainframe and........ ok, there it is.  The info that I need, looks like there are three files.
........
Alright, looks like I have three choices. I can force evolve everyone in the simulation and eject them.  I can release the info I got into every data stream on the system, or I can erase my presence and go back in as some one new.
Looks like each one is set off by a different condition on the server.  I can hack and hit the preverbial "button" to force evolve people. I can erase all the security and let every one know where they are, or I can fill the memory buffer until it overloads and dumps all my info.
