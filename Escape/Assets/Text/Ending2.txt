Now every one knows.  Don't know what will happen, to me or them.  Maybe it will be destroyed, or ignored.  Maybe no one cares.
Maybe the government will crumble, or maybe it will become a new force to be reckoned with.  All I know is that there will be people who get out.
Some one, one person at least, will make it out.
and I'll be waiting, to help them, guide them and make this world our own.  No more government keeping secrets and oprressing every one.  Just life and living the way you want to.
                                                                                                                                                    The End
